**Project Title: Tree/Not Tree Classification using CNN (Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon Dataset)**

**Summary:**
This project focuses on developing a tree/not tree classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model is trained on the dataset provided in the Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon, which consists of labeled images of trees and non-tree objects. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to accurately classify images as either containing a tree or not, enabling applications such as environmental monitoring, forestry management, and urban planning.

**Key Features:**
Tree/Not Tree Classification:
The project aims to classify images into two categories: tree and not tree. This functionality is useful for identifying the presence or absence of trees in various contexts, providing valuable insights for environmental analysis and decision-making processes.

CNN Architecture:
The classification system utilizes a CNN architecture, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in learning visual patterns from images. CNNs are capable of automatically extracting relevant features from input images, enabling accurate classification.

Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon Dataset:
The project leverages the dataset provided in the Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon, which contains a diverse set of images containing trees as well as non-tree objects. This dataset enables comprehensive training of the classification model, ensuring its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on unseen images.

**Technical Approach:**
Data Preprocessing:
The project begins with preprocessing the Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon dataset. This step involves resizing the images to a consistent resolution and normalizing the pixel values to ensure uniformity and optimal training conditions.

CNN Architecture Design:
A CNN architecture is designed for tree/not tree classification. The architecture typically consists of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Techniques such as pooling, dropout, and activation functions are employed to enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

Training on Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon Dataset:
The designed CNN model is trained using the Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon dataset. During training, the model learns to identify discriminative features that distinguish between tree and non-tree images. This is achieved by optimizing the model's parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent, minimizing the classification error.

Evaluation and Testing:
The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model's performance is assessed on a separate test set to measure its ability to correctly classify tree and non-tree images.

Inference on New Images:
Once trained, the model can be used to classify new images as tree or not tree. The input image is fed into the trained CNN, and the model predicts the corresponding class label with a confidence score. This enables the automatic identification of trees in various applications and scenarios.
